# 🔐 Logistic Regression from Scratch – Python Implementation

This repository contains a simple and clear implementation of **Logistic Regression** using **Python and NumPy**, applied to a real dataset for binary classification.

---

## 🧠 What is Logistic Regression?

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical model used for binary classification. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression estimates probabilities using the **sigmoid function** and maps them to discrete classes (0 or 1).

## ⚙️ Features

- Logistic regression model implemented from scratch using NumPy
- Trains on a provided CSV dataset (`data.csv`)
- Includes gradient descent for optimization
- Calculates accuracy, loss, and final weights

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`data.csv`) used in this project is included in the repository. It contains two input features and a binary target label (0 or 1). You can replace it with your own CSV file if needed.
